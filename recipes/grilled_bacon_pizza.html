    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe will make you travel as you eat it!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound prepared pizza dough</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1/3 cup bacon jam</li>
      <li>1/2 cup shredded mozzarella</li>
      <li>1/4 cup ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>1/3 cup cooked, chopped bacon</li>
      <li>1/4 cup arugula, torn</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons pesto</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon balsamic glaze</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons crumbled ricotta salata</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat a gas grill with all burners on High for 10 to 15 minutes. Shape
        pizza dough and brush with olive oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce the flame on half of the grill burners to Low, to create areas of
        direct and indirect heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Carefully place dough, olive oil side facing down, onto the grill over
        direct heat. Close the cover. Let dough grill until the bottom is just
        barely cooked and shows char marks, 1 to 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Flip dough over and cook 2 to 3 more minutes. Remove dough to a baking
        sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread bacon jam over pizza dough; sprinkle mozzarella cheese over
        dough. Place small dollops of ricotta cheese onto pizza. Scatter cooked
        bacon pieces over the pizza.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return pizza to grill and cook until cheese has melted, 3 to 4 more
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Scatter small pieces of arugula onto pizza. Add pesto; drizzle with
        balsamic glaze. Scatter ricotta salata crumbles over pizza. Cut into
        wedges and serve.
      </li>
    </ol>
